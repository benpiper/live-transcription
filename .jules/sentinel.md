## 2024-05-01 - [XSS via DOM innerHTML]
**Vulnerability:** Several places in the frontend dashboard (`static/app.js`) were rendering user-controlled content like transcription text and speaker IDs by directly inserting them into the DOM using `innerHTML` and template literals without any HTML escaping.
**Learning:** Even internal or backend-generated data (like AI-transcribed text or config watchwords) must be treated as untrusted user input before rendering into the DOM, as spoken text could be crafted to include script tags resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
**Prevention:** Always use an HTML escaping function (like `escapeHtml` or DOM elements' `textContent` properties) when dynamically constructing HTML content that includes potentially user-controlled data.

## 2024-05-02 - [Missing and Overly Permissive CORS Configuration]
**Vulnerability:** The application was missing an explicit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in the FastAPI backend (`web_server.py`), meaning cross-origin frontend requests (such as from Render to an on-premise deployment) would fail. Adding CORS configuration securely is required, as allowing all origins (`["*"]`) leads to an overly permissive CORS configuration.
**Learning:** For a split deployment architecture, CORS must be explicitly configured to only permit trusted frontend domains.
**Prevention:** Use an environment variable like `FRONTEND_URL` to define and inject the allowed origins dynamically without resorting to wildcard (`*`) matching, and provide safe fallback origins (like localhost) for local development environments.

## 2025-03-05 - [Regex Injection / ReDoS via Watchwords]
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled watchwords were directly interpolated into a `new RegExp()` constructor in `static/app.js` without sanitization. This allowed users to input regex special characters, leading to Regex Injection and potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) which could crash or slow down the frontend.
**Learning:** Any user-provided strings used to construct regular expressions dynamically must be sanitized.
**Prevention:** Always use an `escapeRegExp` function (like `string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')`) on user input before passing it to the `RegExp` constructor.
## 2024-05-25 - Type Confusion XSS Bypass in Sanitization
**Vulnerability:** DOM XSS bypass allowed due to `escapeHtml` and `escapeJs` returning input unmodified if `typeof !== 'string'`, allowing Arrays or Objects to bypass escaping and trigger XSS during implicit `.toString()` conversion in template literals.
**Learning:** Type-checking sanitization functions can introduce dangerous bypasses. When building string interpolations for `innerHTML`, non-string objects get silently converted to strings *after* they pass the sanitization check.
**Prevention:** Sanitization functions must explicitly handle null/undefined and cast all inputs to strings (`String(unsafe)`) before processing or returning them.
